1. The one thing that is still broken with my code is a loose curly brace that effects the last paint method. Its a simple
problem but i have not had time to fix it yet.
2. The best feature of my code is the running counter of Player win vs dealer wins.
3. Classes are used to create complicated programs by adding individual parts to the main project. The smaller classes can
be used again in other classes to help build/solve the bigger problem.
4. Private variables are only used in that specific class that they are declared in and public variables can be used 
throughout the entire program.
5. Class variables are ones that can be used throughout the specific class that they were declared in and instance
variables are only allowed to be used closed off from the other methods and only used in one.
6. Inheritance is the basis for a set of code and then everything else that is created for the program is based off of 
the beginning code, it is beneficial because it allows infinite uses of the code without having to write it over again.
7. "This" is used to call privated variables into different methods using the exact value that it was given. Super recalls
all previous uses of the base code to help extend and create a different method.
8. The two properties of all objects are state and behaviors
9. One thing that still confuses me is using multiple objects within one method and organizing everything.
